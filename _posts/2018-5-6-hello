#### 《Extractive Summarization Using Multi-Task Learning with Document Classiﬁcation》
###### Masaru et al., EMNLP, 2017

- <b>摘要</b><br/>
&nbsp; The need for automatic document summarization that can be used for practical applications is increasing rapidly. In this paper, we propose a general framework for summarization that extracts sentences from a document using externally related information. Our work is aimed at single document summarization using small amounts of reference summaries. In particular, we address document summarization in the framework of multi-task learning using curriculum learning for sentence extraction and document classification. The proposed framework enables us to obtain better feature representations to extract sentences from documents. We evaluate our proposed summarization method on two datasets: financial report and news corpus. Experimental results demonstrate that our summarizers achieve performance that is comparable to state-of-the-art systems.

#### 《DOC: Deep Open Classiﬁcation of Text Documents》
###### LeiShu et al., EMNLP, 2017
- <b>摘要</b><br/>
&nbsp; Traditional supervised learning makes the closed-world assumption that the classes appeared in the test data must have appeared in training. This also applies to text learning or text classiﬁcation. As learning is used increasingly in dynamic open environments where some new/test documents may not belong to any of the training classes,identifying the senovel documents during classiﬁcation presents an important problem. This problem is called open world classiﬁcation or open classiﬁcation. This paper proposes a novel deep learning based approach. It outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques dramatically.

#### 《Cached Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks for Document-Level Sentiment Classiﬁcation》
###### Jiacheng Xu et al., EMNLP, 2016
- <b>摘要</b><br/>
&nbsp; Recently,neural networks have achieved great success on sentiment classiﬁcation due to their ability to alleviate feature engineering. However, one of the remaining challenges is to model long texts in document-level sentiment classiﬁcation under a recurrent architecture because of the deﬁciency of the memory unit. To address this problem, we present a Cached Long Short-Term Memory neural networks (CLSTM) to capture the overall semantic information in long texts. CLSTM introduces a cache mechanism, which divides memory into several groups with different forgetting rates and thus enables the network to keep sentiment information better within a recurrent unit. The proposed CLSTM outperforms the state-of-the-art models on three publicly available document-level sentiment analysis datasets.

#### 《Document-Level Multi-Aspect Sentiment Classiﬁcationas Machine Comprehension》
###### Yichun Yin et al., EMNLP, 2017
- <b>摘要</b><br/>
&nbsp; Document-level multi-aspect sentiment classiﬁcation is an important task for customer relation management. In this paper, we model the task as a machine comprehension problem where pseudo questionanswer pairs are constructed by a small numberofaspect-relatedkeywordsandaspect ratings. A hierarchical iterative attention model is introduced to build aspectspeciﬁc representations by frequent and repeated interactions between documents and aspect questions. We adopt a hierarchical architecture to represent both word level and sentence level information, and use the attention operations for aspect questions and documents alternatively with the multiple hop mechanism. Experimental results on the TripAdvisor and BeerAdvocate datasets show that our model outperforms classical baselines.
